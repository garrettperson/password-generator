# Password Generator 

## Description

My motivation for this project was to create a password generator using JavaScript. I built this project to generate unique passwords given a set of parameters provided by the user in prompt boxes. This project solves the problem of needing to manually create unique and strong passwords. Throughout the course of the project I learned a lot about JavaScript, especially while loops, if statements, and functions.

##Installation

There are no steps required to install the project, simply accessing the website on a web browser is sufficient to see the project's functionality.

## Usage

The user answers a series of questions provided by prompt boxes upon entering or refreshing the website. Once all of the questions have been answered the user presses the button on screen to generate a unique password that meets their specifications. 

## Credits

I received help from my class' Teaching Assistant during office hours. I referred to StackOverflow when I was stumped and found one particularly useful post regarding the creation of randomized strings of characters.
